# py-pubsubhubbub-subscriber
Very basic unfinished python subscriber with a python http.server
implementation. This is unfinished because the YouTube Data API is 
broken and so what I was going to use it for is no longer an option.

Maybe someone else can get some use out of it... It's a very rough draft.
